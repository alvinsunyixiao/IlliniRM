Referred to NVIDIA Cop. opensource tensorrt tutorial:
https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference

"make" in ./build to compile
"make clean" to delete executable files, all compiled files placed in aarch64. 

Usage, 
aarch64/bin/imagenet-console <inputfile> for inferencing

Network placement,
data/networks/
NOTE that *.tensorcache is generated by the inference engine, make sure to remove this file after any changes to network model to ensure regeneration of network model.
